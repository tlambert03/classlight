Tired of trying to interpret the faces of your students?

Classlight is a minimalist webapp to get non-invasive realtime feedback from your student audience.

----

Students see a webpage with a traffic light graphic. They tap green to indicate "all is well",
yellow to indicate they're having trouble keeping up, and red to indicate they're lost.

Presenters see a pie chart with the current breakdown of red/yellow/green respondents.
